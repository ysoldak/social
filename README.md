## Info
Extracts relationship between web pages and stores extracted directed graph in `.txt` and `.dot` formats.<br>

## Visualization
`.dot` can be visualized in many ways, I prefer [Gephi](https://gephi.org/).

Example of visualization by Gephi:
![sky@juick.com](juick.com_sky_depth1.png "sky@juick.com")

Nodes: 874, Edges: 1632

Gephi settings:

- layout: ForceAtlas 2
- partition/nodes: Degree
- ranking/nodes: Degree
- ranking/edges: Weight
- preview: Black Background with node labels enabled
